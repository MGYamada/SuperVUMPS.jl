# SuperVUMPS.jl

Faster, more stable, and extremely simple.

## TODO

* Currently, we use a Sinkhorn gauge, one of the simplest gauges for efficient calculations. We still do not know whether it is the most efficient.
* Currently, Optim.jl uses a projection as a vector transport. A more efficient vector transport function is desired.
* Supporting FFT
* Supporting non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
* Supporting CUDA
